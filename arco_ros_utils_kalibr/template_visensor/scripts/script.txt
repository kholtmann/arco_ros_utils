0. cd parent folder containing this script

1. Source kalibr workspace

2. If you need to flip the cameras (BEFORE you record data for calibration) see https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_tools/wiki/ViSensor-Fixing,-Flashing,-Etc.#how-to-flash-calibration-onto-the-sensor and flash example calibration file (which already has flipped camera).

3. Bags creation.
    a. record the following bags bags: 
        (1) Cam0 & Ca1 camera, Visensor's IMU,  with cameras throttled, see [1];

    b. create symbolic links to these bags in "bags" sub-folder:
        (1) front_cameras_intrinsics.bag

4. Cameras Calibration (intrinsics). 
   Make sure the whole calibration board is seen @ the beginning
    a. kalibr_calibrate_cameras --target ./parameter_files/april_6x6.yaml --bag ./bags/front_cameras_intrinsics.bag --models pinhole-equi pinhole-equi --topics /cam0/image_raw_throttle /cam1/image_raw_throttle
    b. copy output from current directory to ./out/visensor_cam.yaml
    c. WARNING: **remove in case the 'throttle' string the the rostopic field of the yaml file!**.



  [TODO]  d. Use https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_tools/wiki/ViSensor-Fixing,-Flashing,-Etc. to flash on visensor the new calibration.
